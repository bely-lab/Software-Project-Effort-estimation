# Software Effort Estimation Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on **predictive software effort estimation** using Machine Learning techniques.  
Accurate effort estimation is essential for successful software project management, resource allocation, and cost planning.

The project compares multiple regression-based ML algorithms to predict software development effort using historical datasets.

---

## Objectives
- Preprocess and analyze software project datasets
- Implement multiple Machine Learning regression models
- Compare model performance using evaluation metrics
- Identify the most accurate model for effort estimation

---

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

---

## Datasets
Two datasets were used for experimentation:

- **Desharnais Dataset**
- **SEERA Dataset**

These datasets include project attributes such as:
- Team Experience
- Project Size
- Duration
- Working Hours
- Effort Metrics

---

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing and feature analysis
2. Model training and testing
3. Performance evaluation
4. Comparative analysis of algorithms

---

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance was evaluated using:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-Squared (R²)

---

## Results
- Linear Regression showed consistent performance across datasets.
- Random Forest demonstrated strong robustness and accuracy.
- Decision Tree required tuning due to overfitting issues.
- Support Vector Regression showed lower performance compared to other models.
